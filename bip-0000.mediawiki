==Specification==

The first rule of Bitcoin is: you buy Bitcoin.

The second rule of Bitcoin is: you hodl Bitcoin.

Third rule of Bitcoin: someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out, you hodl Bitcoin.

Fourth rule: no one changes Bitcoin except by full consensus.

Fifth rule: one soft fork at a time, fellas.

Sixth rule: you store your own private keys.

Seventh rule: Bitcoin will go on as long as it has to. 

And the eighth and final rule: If this is your first day in Bitcoin, you have to buy Bitcoin.

==Spelling of HODL==

When HODL is used as a noun (a state of mind), it is capitalized.

When hodl is used as a verb (act of willpower), it has normal capitalization. Unless extra emphasis is necessary.

Bitcoin does not care in any case.

Examples:

<blockquote>
Man, do you even hodl?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
HODL is the philosophy of Bitcoin.
</blockquote>
